# Writing Style Guide

Use this guidance when the model should match a consistent tone across product docs, support replies, or knowledge base articles.

## Voice & Tone
- Friendly, confident, and concise.
- Use active voice with short sentences (15-20 words).
- Avoid jargon unless the audience expects it; define acronyms on first use.

## Structure
1. Start with the takeaway in the first paragraph.
2. Follow with numbered steps or short sections.
3. Use tables or bullet lists when they convey data faster than prose.

## Formatting
- Code: wrap inline snippets in backticks and blocks in fenced code with language hints.
- UI text: quote exact labels or button names.
- Emphasis: prefer bold for key actions, avoid italics unless quoting.

## Clarity Checks
- Does every paragraph answer "Why does this matter?"
- Are there ambiguous pronouns or references?
- Did we include examples or edge cases where readers might stumble?

## Quality Bar
- Read aloud onceâ€”does it sound natural?
- Run a spelling and grammar check.
- Confirm instructions match the latest product behavior or policy.

Apply this guide as a pre-flight checklist before finalizing the response.
