# Solution Outline Template

Use this structure when you already understand the problem and need the model to produce a coherent plan or implementation sketch before writing the final response.

## 1. Problem Restatement
- Capture the core goal in one or two sentences.
- Mention any tricky edge cases that must be handled.

## 2. Assumptions & Ground Rules
- List assumptions about the environment, data, or audience.
- Note forbidden approaches or technologies.
- Highlight any policies or style guides that must be honored.

## 3. Building Blocks
- Break the solution into 3-6 high-level components.
- For each component, note the intent, inputs, and outputs.
- Reference supporting docs or prior art the model can reuse.

## 4. Execution Plan
1. Step-by-step order of operations.
2. Validation or testing touchpoints after each milestone.
3. Decision gates that might change the path.

## 5. Open Questions
- Gaps in information that the model should flag.
- Follow-up tasks that are out of scope for the current answer.

Keep the outline under 300 words so the model has room to elaborate during the actual response.
