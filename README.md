# Prompt Kit

Lightweight library of reusable LLM-ready documents. Every Markdown file is meant to be copied, tweaked, and pasted directly into your chat interface when you need a structured response fast.

## What's inside

- `docs/` – short templates that capture the shape of common workflows (kickoffs, debugging, outlining, writing style, diagramming, Claude Code architecture patterns)
- `architectures/` – longer reference documents for complex system design and multi-step projects
- `LICENSE` – MIT license for sharing and remixing

Add new templates by dropping a Markdown file into `docs/` and referencing it from `docs/index.md`. For longer architecture guides, use `architectures/`.

## Usage

1. Open the document that matches the job you're tackling.
2. Fill in the blanks or update the checklist for your exact scenario.
3. Paste the final version into your LLM prompt.

Keep contributions short, scannable, and free of tool-specific instructions so they work across models.
